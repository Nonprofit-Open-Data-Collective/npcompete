\title{Normalized Herfindahl–Hirschman Index}
\usage{
get_nhhi(df, geo, subsector, resource, normalizer, resource.name = "resource")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the required fields for computing the metric(hhi) grouped by geographical level and sub sector.}

\item{geo}{A character string indicating the column name for geographical area unique code.}

\item{subsector}{A character string indicating the column name for sub sectors.}

\item{resource}{A character string indicating the column name for resource based on which HHI is calculated. Example: Revenue, assets etc.}

\item{normalizer}{A character string indicating the column name for the column used to normalize the HHI index.}

\item{resource.name}{A character string indicating the column name for the new column generated with aggregated resource.}
}
\value{
A new dataframe with the normalized Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (\code{hhi}),
grouped by geographical level and sub sectors.
}
\description{
Calculate the normalized Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) and return a dataframe.
}
\details{
The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index(HHI) is a measure of market concentration that is used to understand market competitiveness,
competitive behavior and performance in markets. The index could be calculated as the sum of the squared market share of each firm
competing in a market (Thornton & Belski, 2010).In the nonprofit sector, market share is determined by the ratio of a nonprofit's
total revenue to the aggregate revenue for the organization’s market.The formula used here is \eqn{{\sigma \frac{resource}{Total resource}}^2 - \frac{\frac{1}{normalizer}}{1-\frac{1}{normalizer}}}
The calculated values range from 1/N to 1, where N is the number of organizations in a market. A market with an HHI of 1 is considered as
a monopoly. In contrast, a market with an HHI close to 0 would be viewed as a nearly competition one.
